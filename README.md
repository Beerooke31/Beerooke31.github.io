## Project Requirements

### Content

Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make?

I didn’t want to overdo any of the stylistic elements, so chose to go with some bright poppy colours on a white background with some purple containers to showcase my bio and projects. I felt that keeping the text black was best for readability but still wanted to add a dash of character with the different colours. I chose to have the Github and LinkedIn icons in my footer because that’s often where I see them displayed on sites and feel like they’re a good addendum to a webpage.

- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
      ​

### Technical

Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from?

My main design strategy/decision was to make the webpage functional but fun. Having the navigation links in my header is straightforward and doesn’t require the user to get bogged down by trying to navigate a page with too many icons. I chose to keep the majority of my content centred because I felt that that worked best for the arrangement of the page, especially when changing between screen sizes. I will admit my use of semantic HTML is somewhat limited, but I did include a header and footer, as well as a section for the hero and div’d it up the rest of the way.

- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)

Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any.

- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
