      Hi there, I'm Brooke - a new kid on the block. I’m a driven and
      enthusiastic software developer with a flair for creating innovative
      solutions with a bit of pizzazz. I’m a member of the She Codes 24-25
      cohort and am excited to bring my skills and fresh perspective to new and
      challenging projects. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always
      eager to learn from others while also sharing my knowledge. I’m passionate
      about continued education and continuously expanding my skill set through
      online courses and tech meetups. Let’s connect and explore how I can
      contribute to your team’s success! If you’re looking for a dedicated
      developer for your next project I’m keen to get down to the nitty gritty
      and see how we can work together.
    </p>
